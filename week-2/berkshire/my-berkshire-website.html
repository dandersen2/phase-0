    - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
      I have done a little bit of htis type of work before so this wasn't a total surprise for me, but it is always satisfying to see the bare code take shape in th browser. Also knowing how to actually work with and edit the file using git. sublime, and GitHub is pretty exciting because of the huge number of things you can do with all of these tools combined.

    - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
      W3 schools has a very thorough explanation of all the semantic elements and I found the "Try it yourself" button to be especially useful in experimenting with how the browser interprets different things. Being able to do some trial and error is sometimes the way I learn best so I enjoyed that functionality.

    - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
      Ultimately, separating the HTML from the CSS formatting seems to make things a lot easier as all you have to do is focus on the basic layout of the page and adding the content in the right order with the proper tag.

    - What seems good and bad about HTML?
      HTML seems to be extremely powerful considering its simplicity. Since it is the only markup language in use today, I can asume that every site I have ever visited was built with it and that alone is a pretty impressive fact. I suppose HTML has the downside of being a little tedious because it involves a lot of typing, copying, and pasting, and not much interaction with the page or other functionality.

    - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
      Using a clean and organized indentation scheme is the best way I found to visualize everything within a document made up of purely HTML. Remembering that most tags need a closing tag is important but other than that, most of the syntax is quickly accessible with a quick internet search until I become familiar with it to memorize more of the useful elements.
