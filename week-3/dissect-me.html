      			<h3>Version Control (From Dan's blog)</h3>
      			  Version control allows developers to work on small or massively large projects with one or many different collaborators simultaneously. It can also be used by writers, designers, or any typ of knowledge worker. It keeps track of all the changes that have been made on a project including when the changes were made, who made them, and allows you to post comments describing why you did so. This is an incredibly useful tool fro when multiple peopl are working on the same project, but is also useful for solo projects in case you make a mistake and want to undo it or go back in time to a previous state of a file. Version control (VC) keeps all of the different versions(hence the name) of your project on file so that you can refer back to them or revert back entirely if necessary. If multiple collaborators are making changes to the same file, it also allows all those changes to be "merged" into the master copy without overwriting eachother. Any budding developer, coder, or writer, would be wise to learn how to use and take advantage of this wonderfully modern tool.
