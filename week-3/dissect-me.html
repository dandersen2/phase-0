      			<h3>Version Control (From Dan's blog)</h3>
      			  Version control allows developers to work on small or massively large projects with one or many different collaborators simultaneously. It can also be used by writers, designers, or any typ of knowledge worker. It keeps track of all the changes that have been made on a project including when the changes were made, who made them, and allows you to post comments describing why you did so. This is an incredibly useful tool fro when multiple peopl are working on the same project, but is also useful for solo projects in case you make a mistake and want to undo it or go back in time to a previous state of a file. Version control (VC) keeps all of the different versions(hence the name) of your project on file so that you can refer back to them or revert back entirely if necessary. If multiple collaborators are making changes to the same file, it also allows all those changes to be "merged" into the master copy without overwriting eachother. Any budding developer, coder, or writer, would be wise to learn how to use and take advantage of this wonderfully modern tool.

          What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
            I have become familiar with the head, title, body, section, p, li, ul, article, and h tags. These seem like the most essential and useful tags in HTML for our purposes so far. Some others that I will implement in our upcoming work are <nav>, <aside>, <header>, and <footer> tags. The use of the semantic elements tags in html make your html easier to read and understand as well as making it easier to apply css later without having to create different names for every div. If you use the same basic structure and semeantic elements across all of the pages of your website, the styling will apply to all of them correctly and automatically, saving lots of time customizing the CSS to each page.

          How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
            I the elements in your html file are laid out on the page in order from top to bottom. If you want something to be located at the top of the page, it should be at the top of the html file. Other ordering and placement of elements can be achieved using CSS, but the default alignment will be based upon the html.

          What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
            In this challenge I learned how to use Sublime's built-in tools to create a snippet that can act as a shortcut for setting up a certain type of file. In the future, if I want to set up an html file, all I have to do is type "html" followed by the tab key and Sublime will create the basic skeleton that I need for that type of file. I've also started to use the 'ctrl' click function that allows you to type or insert or delete text in multiple places at once. This is useful if you are making changes that apply to multiple elements or tags in your document.
