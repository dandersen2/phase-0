Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
We used << which pushes an element to an array or hash. In this case, we
pushed an array to another array.
We used if/else as a conditional to help sort the elements to the output array.
We used .each to iterate over the input array in order to sort it.

  We implemented the my_array_splitting_method and the
  my_hash_splitting_method in order to take information out of arrays and sort
  or organize them into different arrays based on data type or value. These
  methods could be altered to sort arrays based on variety of different factors
  .

  my_array_splitting_method takes the input of an array containing  a variety
  of data types and separates it into an array containing a sub-array of all
  the integer elements , and a sub-array with elements of all other data types.
  In order to run this method, simply call my_array_splitting_method on a new line in Ruby with the array that you want to sort in the argument.

  "my_array_splitting_method" performs the following:
  1)  It make new array called output_array to hold a copy of the input to
  make sure that original array is not changed, because it is a non-
  destructive method.
  1.a) "output_array" contains 2 sub-arrays.  The first sub-array is at index
  zero, and the second sub-array is at index 1.
  2)  Next, it goes through each element and checks if it is an integer.
  3)  IF the element is an integer, the method copies this element into
  the sub-array at index zero of "output_array".
  4)  IF element is NOT an integer the method copies this element into
  the sub-array at index 1 of "output_array".
  5)  Lastly, "my_array_splitting_method" returns the output_array.

  "my_hash_splitting_method" takes the input of a hash containing key/value
  pairs of a pet's name and age, and sorts the pairs into an output array based
   on the age values. In order to run this method, simply call my_hash_splitting_method on a new line in Ruby with the array that you want to sort and the age that you want to sort by in the argument.

   "my_hash_splitting_method" performs the following:
  1)  It makes new array called all_pets_array to hold a copy of the input to
  make sure that original hash is not changed, because it is a non-
  destructive method.
  1.a) "all_pets_array" contains 2 sub-arrays.  The first sub-array is at index
  zero, and the second sub-array is at index 1.
  2)  Next, it goes through each element and checks if the age value for the key/value pair is less than the given age argument.
  3)  IF the age value of the key/value pair is less than the given age argument for the method, the method copies this pair into
  the sub-array at index zero of "all_pets_array".
  4)  Otherwise (Else) the method copies this key/value pair into
  the sub-array at index 1 of "all_pets_array".
  5)  Lastly, "my_hash_splitting_method" returns the all_pets_array.
